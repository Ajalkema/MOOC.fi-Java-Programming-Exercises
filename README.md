# MOOC.fi-Java-Programming-Exercises
Exercises of the Java programming course on MOOC.fi offered by University of Helsinki's (UoH) department of Computer Science. From part 4 onwards I made use of the templates supplied by UoH.

The topics per part are the following:

### Java programming I
- Part 1: Printing, reading input, variables, simple calculations, conditional statements/operations  
- Part 2: Patterns to solve recurring problems, repeating functionality, loops, methods  
- Part 3: Debugging, lists, arrays, strings  
- Part 4: Object-oriented programming, objects in a list, files and reading data  
- Part 5: More object-oriented programming, overloading methods, constructors, primitive and reference variables, objects and references  
- Part 6: Objects in a list and lists as part of an object, seperating the user interface from program logic, introduction to testing  
- Part 7: Programming paradigms, algorithms. Includes three larger programming exercises

### Java programming II
- Part 8: HashMaps, Similarity of objects, Grouping data using hash maps
